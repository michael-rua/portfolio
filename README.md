Kia ora,

This is my current portfolio site, still a WIP although near the end of development.

you can run npm i, then npm start to get the localhost version of the website. 

Otherwise view at **michaelrua.dev** for the latest working version.

Technology used is, Create-React-App & React & HTML & CSS
